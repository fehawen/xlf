xlf - x list fonts
------------------

xlf is a teeny-weeny helper to list available fonts returned by XListFonts().


Requirements
------------

Needless to say, you need the Xlib header files to build xlf.


Installation
------------

xlf is installed into ~/bin by default. Unless changed, do not run make as root.

    $ make clean install


Usage
-----

xlf takes one optional pattern string argument that is case-insensitive and
can contain wildcard characters.

If no argument is passed, a single asterisk wildcard is used to find all
available fonts.

For details on the XListFonts() pattern string, see:
https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.5/doc/man/man3/XListFonts.3.html

    $ xlf
    $ xlf "*iso8859??"
    $ xlf "-xos4-terminus-medium-r-normal*"
    $ xlf "*bold*"
    $ xlf "fixed"


Why on earth
------------

I was playing around with X and needed to know which fonts were available.
